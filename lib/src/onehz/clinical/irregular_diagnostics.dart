// CLINICAL — the evidence behind an irregular-rhythm screen verdict.
//
// What it is for: `irregularBeatScreen` computes the beat counts, the cleaning
// counts and the per-5-minute-window counts on its way to a flag, then throws
// them away. A reader who sees "flagged" or "not screened" cannot tell why.
// [IrregularDiagnostics] keeps them, for a screen that RAN and for one that
// ABSTAINED (an abstention carries the counts that caused it).
//
// Absent stays absent: an input the caller did not give is null, never 0. The
// batch call and the streaming `IrregularScreenState` must produce the same
// diagnostics for the same beats, however chunked or restored.
