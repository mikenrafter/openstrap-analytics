// CLINICAL — 24/7 irregular-rhythm SCREEN (NOT a diagnosis).
//
// A pulse-derived screen for sustained beat-to-beat irregularity over a long RR
// window (whole day / sleep). It does NOT diagnose atrial fibrillation or any
// arrhythmia — it flags when the RR scatter is large and disorganised enough to
// warrant "if you have symptoms, see a clinician". Two independent markers must
// BOTH fire to reduce motion/ectopy false positives:
//
//   1. Poincaré SD1/SD2 ratio high — the scatter is round, not cigar-shaped
//      (organised sinus rhythm sits on the identity line → low SD1/SD2).
//   2. pNNx high — a large fraction of successive intervals differ by > x ms,
//      the classic irregularly-irregular signature.
//
// HONESTY: PRV not ECG. Wrist pulse misses P-waves entirely; this is a screen.
// Gated hard on beat count and artifact fraction — a noisy night never flags.
