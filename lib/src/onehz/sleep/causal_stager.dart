// SLEEP — CAUSAL (online) 3-class stager: wake | nrem | rem | absent.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. [cardioStager] is a RETROSPECTIVE night scorer: every
// feature window is centred on its epoch (so it reads 90-150 s of the future),
// the motion / HR / z-score baselines are whole-night, and three post-passes
// (mode filter, Webster rescore, bout consolidation) all look BOTH ways. None
// of that exists at 06:40 when something has to decide, right now, whether the
// sleeper is in REM. Re-running the retrospective stager every tick is not a
// causal stager either: its newest epochs would be scored on truncated windows
// and a baseline that is still moving. This file is the online counterpart,
// built from the SAME features, weights and cutoffs wherever those can be
// computed from the past alone:
//
//   same        motion (ENMO vs a local 1 g reference), HR mean / SD, SDNN,
//               R(k), LF/HF; the physiologic RR gate; the REM axis weights
//               (kRemWeight*, the measured DREAMT effect sizes); the shipped
//               REM cutoff (kDefaultRemScoreCut); the wake / atonia / HR-floor
//               rules; minHrCoverage; the 0.6 confidence ceiling.
//   made causal every centred window becomes a TRAILING window ending at the
//               epoch's end (300 s SDNN; 180 s R(k) and LF/HF — their full
//               lengths; 120 s for the 1 g reference, see [_gRefWinSec]; 90 min
//               for the local HR gates);
//               whole-night baselines become expanding baselines over what has
//               been seen so far (capped at [CausalStagerConfig.historyEpochs]).
//   dropped     Webster rescore and bout consolidation: both need the FUTURE
//               side of a bout. Nothing replaces them; a causal wake is
//               therefore not bridged the way the retrospective one is, and
//               [CausalStageObservation.runSec] says how long a stage has
//               persisted so the caller can demand persistence itself. The
//               3-epoch mode filter is replaced by a trailing 2-of-3 vote.
//   not carried the personal profile blend ([SleepUserProfile]) and the deep
//               overlay. This is wake / nrem / rem, per-night-local only.
//
// WHAT IT IS NOT. A wrist autonomic ESTIMATE (tier ESTIMATE), never
// polysomnography, never an EEG-defined stage, never a diagnosis. The offline
// stager scores kappa 0.13 against PSG on the held-out DREAMT split; this is
// a causal cousin of that stager with fewer smoothing passes, and agreement
// with the offline hypnogram is a consistency check, not an accuracy figure.
// `confidence` is EVIDENCE QUALITY (HR coverage, RR coverage), capped at
// [kMaxSleepConfidence] — it is not a probability that the stage is right.
//
// THE CONTRACT
//
//   CausalStager.observe(window, priorState) -> CausalStageObservation
//
//   * CAUSAL. Only samples stamped strictly before window.nowMs are read (a
//     sample stamped t describes [t, t+1 s)); the rest are counted and ignored. An epoch is staged only after it has fully closed,
//     and its features look backwards only.
//   * REPLAYABLE. Pure and deterministic: no clock, no randomness, no I/O, no
//     hash-order dependence. The caller supplies `nowMs`. The same sequence of
//     windows gives byte-identical observations and states.
//   * REPLACEMENT-TOLERANT. A window is authoritative for the time span it
//     covers, per channel: stored samples inside that span are replaced by the
//     window's. Re-sending a window, overlapping windows, and corrected
//     re-sends converge on the state a clean feed would have produced. Samples
//     older than 600 s behind the newest stored sample are IGNORED (counted in
//     trace['ignoredStale']): their features are frozen.
//   * SERIALISABLE. [CausalStagerState] is plain data (toJson/fromJson) and
//     bounded: ~15 min of raw samples plus [CausalStagerConfig.historyEpochs]
//     feature rows. It crosses an isolate boundary as-is.
//   * HONEST. It abstains, with a [CausalAbstention] reason, instead of
//     guessing: no / stale / regressing clock, off-skin, missing HR or accel,
//     thin coverage, or warm-up evidence too thin. An absent stage always has
//     confidence 0 and runSec 0, and a previous stage is never carried across
//     an abstention.
//
// INPUT CONTRACT. 1 Hz HR and accel (one sample per second bucket; whole-second
// windows) plus RR beats whose timestamps are the record second (`rr_ts_ms`).
// Start from `prior == null` at in-bed time: the API stages whatever it is
// given and has no sleep-onset detector, so feeding it the waking afternoon
// would build its baselines from waking physiology.
//
// LATENCY, stated plainly: a stage describes the newest CLOSED 30 s epoch, and
// its RR features are trailing 3-5 min windows whose centres sit 1.5-2.5 min
// behind it — the price of not looking ahead. See docs/CAUSAL_STAGER.md for the
// measured agreement and the false- / late-trigger behaviour.
